# Zero-deforestation-mission

Deforestation is the permanent removal of standing forests, and for that it was created an algorithm to detect that images with a VGG model and transfer learning

# Dataset

For this challenge, you will have 2 CSVs: Train and Test. As their names indicate, the first one will be used to train your classification model on the forest images and test to know to which label they belong. It is important to remember to be careful with the paths for reading images in the train_test_data folder.
